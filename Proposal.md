####**Proposal**

Internet of things technology is adopted in every field. Our proposed Smart cold storage and inventory monitoring system uses sensor-based IoT technology to offer remote monitoring and tracking the produce. Our paper proposed methodology is early warning alerts and notifications in critical conditions. It enables end-end visibility and accountability across the entire product value chain.This project continuously monitors the temperature in the cold storage facility with the help of LM35 temperature sensor. The operator sets a predefined threshold temperature value for the storage unit. The current values are displayed on the monitor with the help of Ubuntu software. If the threshold temperature is crossed, an SMS alert is sent to the operator along with the value of the current temperature reading of the storage unit. Also, visual and auditory cues are sent to the people nearby via lighting of an LED and the buzzing sound from the buzzer.
