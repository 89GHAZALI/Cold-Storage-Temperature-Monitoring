####**Proposal**

Internet of things technology is adopted in every field. Our proposed Smart cold storage and inventory monitoring system uses sensor-based IoT technology to offer remote monitoring and tracking the produce. Our paper proposed methodology is early warning alerts and notifications in critical conditions. It enables end-end visibility and accountability across the entire product value chain.This project continuously monitors the temperature in the cold storage facility with the help of LM35 temperature sensor. The operator sets a predefined threshold temperature value for the storage unit. The current values are displayed on the monitor with the help of Ubuntu software. If the threshold temperature is crossed, an SMS alert is sent to the operator along with the value of the current temperature reading of the storage unit. Also, visual and auditory cues are sent to the people nearby via lighting of an LED and the buzzing sound from the buzzer.

####**Problem Statement**

Several research and technology challenges need to addressed towards the implementation of IoT applications as well as the potential realization of horizontal IoT platforms. The most important challenges, based on our findings, are listed below.

1) Technological Interoperability: Interoperability is significantly more challenging for the IoT as it is not (only) about connecting people with people, but about a seamless interaction between devices and people with devices. These devices can differ regarding their technological capabilities.

2) Semantic Interoperability: For full interoperability, it is necessary that the devices interpret the shared information correctly and act accordingly, which is covered by the semantic aspect of interoperability usually referred to as Information Model. Hence, improvements have to be made regarding distributed ontologies, semantic web, or semantic device discovery.

3) Smart Things: Ultra low power circuits and devices capable of tolerating harsh environments have to be developed. Moreover, parallel processing in low power multi-processorsystems, adaptation, autonomous behavior while guaranteeing trust, privacy and security, as well as battery, energy harvesting and storage technologies are among the core challenges regarding the devices in the IoT.
